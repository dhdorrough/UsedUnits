# UsedUnits
 
The UsedUnits program can scan a Delphi program and/or units to construct a list of all units which are used by that program and/or unit. Once scanned, any one of the involved units can be selected to see what units it uses or is used by. In the Used Unit tab, specify the file path/name using the Main Program text box and browser

Once scanned it then becomes possible to find out how two units are connected. i.e., “Why is this unit getting compiled?”. This is done on the Find Relation page.

By default, directories associated with the project are scanned as is the .DOF paths. Additional paths to search for source code files can be added on the Setup Page.
